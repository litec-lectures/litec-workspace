# Arduino Setup

> That one is pretty easy to setup!

1. Ensure, that you have `vscode` installed (see [VsCode Setup](./03_VsCodeSetup.md)).
2. Elevated powershell console:

   ```powershell
   winget install arduino
   code --install-extension vsciot-vscode.vscode-arduino
   ```

3. You are DONE! (Rest will be discussed during lessons.)
