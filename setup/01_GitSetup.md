# GIT

## Setup

1. Open an elevated PowerShell console.

2. Run the following command within the console:

   ```powershell
   choco install git -y
   ```

3. Close and reopen the  elevated PowerShell console.

4. Perform the 2 commands (replace`<fullname>` with your name (whitespaces are ok), and `<email>` with the given school email address).

   ```powershell
   git config --global user.name "<fullname>"
   git config --global user.email "<email>"
   ```

   More information on a first setup can be found on: [First Time Git Setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).
