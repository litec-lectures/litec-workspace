# Android Setup

> That one is fairly easy to setup!

1. Elevated PowerShell console:

   ```powershell
   winget install Google.AndroidStudio
   ```

   This might take some time...

2. Start Android Studio and setup the basics (follow the installation wizard)
   - Choose `Standard` Setup
   - Light or dark mode is up to you
   - Click `Finish`and wait...

   These steps install a SDK (software Development Kit), an emulator and emulation accelerator - all tools needed for Android development.

3. Close the Android Studio start window (or try it our yourself a bit).
4. You are DONE!

**For Experienced Users**: *If you know what you are doing you could have chosen `custom` setup instead of `standard` and change the default installation paths.*
