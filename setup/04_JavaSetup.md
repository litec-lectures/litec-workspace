# Java Setup

> A pretty easy one to install!

1. Start an elevated powershell console, and perform the following commands:

   ```powershell
   choco install openjdk17 maven intellijidea-community -y
   ```

2. You are DONE!

## Some Additional Information

- We will use OpenJDK 17 for the next year(s), as it is an LTS (Long Time Support) version.
- We will use maven as our standard **build tool** from the command line (and within Intellij). Gradle build tool will just be used with Android Studio.
- Community Edition of Intellj IDE is sufficient for most exercises and use cases at LiTec. If the Ultimate version is needed you will get instructions during the lessons.
