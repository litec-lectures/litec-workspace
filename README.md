# LiTec Software Setup Information Repository

A repository to present all relevant information for IT (and maybe other) students of the Linzer Technikum (LiTec) to setup their personal notebook.

> The following guide has its main focus on a setup of Windows 10 notebooks / workstations! MacOS or linux users have to use different package managers (Mac: brew/homebrew, linux: apt, rpm, pacman,...) and install routines (and you are going to have trouble to use Visual Studio :wink: ).

## Overview

The typical IT student of the Linzer Technikum is going to use the following tools in his career:

1. Packagemanager: [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) - for an installation guide see @tbd
   - :warning: **This tool is used to install ALL software that we need, so don't start to download any installers from webpages!**
2. Markdown editor: [Typora](https://typora.io/) - see @tbd
3. General purpose editor (also ok to use for markdown): [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - see @tbd
   - This editor is going to be our "swiss army knife"  - **GET USED TO IT!**
4. Version Control System (VCS): [git](https://git-scm.com/) - see @tbd
5. Java development IDE: [IntellijIdea Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - see @tbd
6. C# development IDE: [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - see @tbd
7. Microcontroller: [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) - see @tbd
8. Android: [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) - see @tbd
9. Containerization: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) - see @tbd

> DISCLAIMER - this list is definitely not fully populated! Just the most important tools are mentioned here.

## Setup

1. Start with [Chocolatey Setup](./setup/00_ChocoInstall.md) - the installation guide for the package manager chocolatey.
   - It also contains information about the base packages everyone needs (e.g. Typora).
2. Next install the software packages that ALL students of all grades need. See @tbd
3. After that it depends on the grade you are in:
   - **2nd grade students** perform all steps of the following documents:
     - [Git and Github Setup](setup/01_GitSetup.md)
     - []
   - **3rd grade students** - check if you got all from 2nd year and then go here
   - **4th and 5th grade students** - check if you got all from the previous years and then go here
