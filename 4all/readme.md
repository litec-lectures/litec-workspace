## Mandatory Basic Knowledge

### "Elevated PowerShell Console"

If you read somewhere within the text a formulation like *"open a powershell console as administrator"*, *"start an elevated powershell console"*, or *"within an elevated powershell console"*, then you need to perform the following steps:

1. Right Click on the Windows StartMenu Icon - normally positioned at the bottom left of your Windows10 (or Windows 11) system.
2. Choose `WindowsPowerShell (Admin)` entry of the context menu.
3. Click on `Yes`.
4. DONE!

**Alternative:**

- Open the search field, type in `powershell` and choose `Run as Adminstrator`.
